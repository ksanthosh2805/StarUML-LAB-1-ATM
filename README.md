# LAB-1-ATM
## ATM and Banking SYSTEM
### AIM: 
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of ATM
System.

<br>

### SRS(Procedure):
#### Use Case Diagram
- First, identify the **actors** (like `Customer`, `Technician`) and the **system boundary** (the "ATM"). Then, list all the **use cases** (functions like `Withdraw Cash`, `Maintain ATM`) inside the boundary and connect the actors to the functions they perform.

#### Class Diagram
- Identify the main **classes** (nouns like `Account`, `Customer`). For each class, define its **attributes** (data like `+AccNo`) and **methods** (actions like `+checkBalance()`). Finally, draw lines to show **relationships** like inheritance ("is-a") and association ("has-a") between them.

#### Activity Diagram
- Map the step-by-step **workflow** for a single use case (like "Withdrawal") from a start node to an end node. Use **action** boxes for steps, **diamond** shapes for decisions (like "PIN Valid?"), and thick bars to show **parallel activities**.

#### Sequence Diagram
- Show how objects interact **over time** for one specific scenario (like "Account Creation"). Place objects as vertical **lifelines** across the top and draw **numbered messages** from top to bottom to show the exact sequence of calls between them.

#### Communication Diagram
- This diagram shows the **relationships** between objects rather than time. Place the objects (`Customer`, `Manager`, `ATM`) on the diagram, draw **links** between them, and then add **numbered messages** along those links to show the sequence of communication.

#### Package Diagram
- Group related classes from your class diagram into **packages** (like folders, e.g., `Accounts`, `Transactions`, `UserManagement`). This organizes your system into logical modules. Then, draw dashed arrows (dependencies) to show when one package needs to use a class from another.
